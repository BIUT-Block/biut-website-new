##about 关于项目 -- 技术优势
a-adv = Technology advantage
a-list-tit1 = Consensus algorithm
a-list-txt1 = Polling Group proof of work, integrated with pos and pow consensus algorithm advantages, achieves decentralized POW mine digging.
a-list-tit2 = High TPS in decentralization
a-list-txt2 = There are 174 nodes in the test network and 33 000 TPS in 10 communities. The increase of nodes and node community is able to achieve 174 nodes in high TPS test network and 33000TPS networks in 10 communities. The major network increases with the node and node community, which can achieve high TPS.
a-list-tit3 = Excellent decentralization
a-list-txt3 = High TPS and de-centralization, can break through the impossible delta principle of the distributed system.
a-list-tit4 = Effectively reduction of development difficulty
